# Recursion in C Programming This repository contains a collection of tasks related to **C - Recursion** as part of the **ALX Low Level Programming** curriculum. ## Table of Contents - [Introduction](#introduction) - [Tasks](#tasks) - [Utility Files](#utility-files) - [Compilation](#compilation) ## Introduction Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This repository focuses on various recursion-based tasks implemented in the C programming language. ## Tasks 1. **0-puts_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion. 2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string in reverse using recursion. 3. **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A function that returns the length of a string using recursion. 4. **3-factorial.c**: A function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion. 5. **4-pow_recursion.c**: A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion. 6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A function that calculates the natural square root of a number using recursion. 7. **6-is_prime_number.c**: A function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion. ## Utility Files - **main.h**: This file contains all the function prototypes for the tasks. - **_putchar.c**: A utility function used to print characters. ## Compilation To compile the utility and task functions, use the following command: ```sh gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 utility_file.c task_file.c -o output_file ``` Replace `utility_file.c` with the relevant utility file, `task_file.c` with the specific task file, and `output_file` with the desired output file name (same as the task function name without the `.c` extension). Feel free to explore each task and its corresponding utility files. Happy coding!
